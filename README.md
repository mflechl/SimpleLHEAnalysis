LHEanalysis
===========

The project provides python support for loading and sub-automatic analysis of LHE (Les Houches Event) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Houches_Accords] files. LHE files are standardized interface between the matrix element programs and the event generators.

Currently the project supports data loading and calculation of additional kinematic variables, provides plotting methods and several simple analysis tools. Finally, output CSV files can be exported. 

Apart from above generic methods specific analysis of: pp > jjw+w+, w+ > mu+ vm is delivered. The analysis of provided code allows for understanding of how to use the code and how to extend it for new processes.
